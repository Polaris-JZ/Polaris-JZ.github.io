Hi! This is Jujia Zhao, a master student from National University of Singapore. My major is Industry 4.0 (Deep Learning for Industry). I graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology in China with a bachelor's degree in Automation. Now, I am a research intern at NExT Research Center in NUS, advised by [Dr. Wenjie Wang](https://wenjiewwj.github.io/). My research focuses on recommendation and information retrieval.


# üìù Publications 

- [Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01560.pdf)

  TLDR: *We propose a novel interactive planning approach using LLMs that brings a planning-based agent to the apex of Minecraft (an open-world environment) for the first time.*
