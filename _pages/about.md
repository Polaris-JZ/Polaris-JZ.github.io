# About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! This is Jujia Zhao, a master student from **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. My major is Industry 4.0 (Deep Learning for Industry). I graduated from **Beijing Institute of Technology** in China with a bachelor's degree in Automation. Now, I am a research intern at [NExT Research Center](https://www.nextcenter.org/) in NUS, advised by [Dr. Wenjie Wang](https://wenjiewwj.github.io/). My research focuses on artificial intelligence, information retrieval and recommendation.
